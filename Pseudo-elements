selector::pseudo-element {

 property: value; 

}

It is important to note that pseudo-elements use two colon characters instead of one.

Now, let’s explore some examples of popular pseudo-elements.

::first-letter
You can use first-letter to change the color of just the first letter of each of the three points in the example text.

HTML code:
<!DOCTYPE html> 

<html> 

    <head> 

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="pseudo4.css"> 

    </head> 

<body> 

    <ul> 

        <li>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. </li> 

    <li>The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12–15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.</li> 

    <li>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.</li> 

  </ul> 

</body> 

</html> 


CSS code:
li::first-letter { 

color:coral; 

font-size: 1.3em; 

font-weight: bold; 

line-height: 1; 

} 

::first-line
First-line will change the complete first line of each of the bullet points to light sea green. 

CSS code:
ul{
    list-style-type: none;
}

li::first-line {
    color: lightseagreen;
    text-decoration: underline;
    line-height: 1;
}



::selection
Selection is another useful pseudo-element. For example, you may use it when you are taking notes on your device because it allows you to highlight specific text. The effect of it becomes obvious only after the user selects content. On web pages today, you will typically see inverted colors from white-black to black-white when selecting a portion of text.

CSS code:
ul{
    list-style-type: none;
}

li::selection {
    color:brown;
    background-color: antiquewhite;
    line-height: 1;
}

::marker  
Markers are typically used to add style elements to a list, for instance, to color bullet points. For example, you can enhance the user experience when you use a marker in the following way.    

CSS code:
li::marker {
    color: cornflowerblue;
    content: '<> ';
    font-size: 1.1em;
}


:before and ::after
One more pair of pseudo-elements are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. They allow you to add content before and after an element on which they are allowed. In other words, new content can be added to a page without adding HTML code for it. You can also add styling options for this content. Let’s do an example where text is added both before and after some cooking guidelines to identify them as important tips. 

HTML code:
<body>
    <p id="tips"> Don't rinse your pasta after it is drained. </p>
    <p> Slice the tomatoes. Take the extra efforts to seed them. </p>
    <p id="tips"> Peel and seed large tomatoes. </p>
</body>

CSS code:
#tips::before{
    background: darkkhaki;
    color:darkslategray;
    content: "Tip:";
    padding-left: 3px;
    padding-right: 5px;
    border-radius: 10%;
}

#tips::after{
    background:darkkhaki;
    color:darkslategray;
    content: "!!";
    padding-right: 5px;
    border-radius: 20%;
}
